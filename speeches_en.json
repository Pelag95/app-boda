    "text": "Hi, I'm Miguel. This is the sixth internet manual on “How to write a wedding speech” that I read, I find it really difficult not to end up using chatGPT so I'm going to try it by myself: I've been friends with Alberto since college, I met Pauline about 10 years later, she seems like a nice girl. In those 10 years I have seen Alberto in many situations (when they are married I will tell you which ones), but I don't think I have ever seen him so in love with someone. The proof is to see me up here, with my Zara blazer and overcoming stage fright to try to talk about the love that two people who were not even born in the same country and with different cultures process, it's nice, isn't it? Camela already said it in the song amor.com in 2001, 'Love, you have no borders'. I'm sure they know better than me what they feel so I'm going to take the opportunity to comment that I'm single! and I'm looking for someone who ... (This I did list in the AI) Who is understanding and caring, loyal and honest, funny and patient, someone with whom I can share laughs, support each other and build a relationship based on trust and above all, loves me at least half as much as Albertito and little Pauline love each other, that would be enough for me. While my offer is heard by someone, I will continue to enjoy the perfect example of how to manage a relationship, having fun with them and of course, enjoying the wine and cheese they put out when they invite us to their house. I say farewell quoting Maria Zambrano, for this is why I got in my university entrance exam: 'To love is to lose oneself in the depths of the other'. Here's to continuing to lose yourselves together.",

    "text": "Hi everyone, we're friends of Alberto's. Everyone looks amazing today, especially the bride and groom. We've noticed that Alberto has always had the habit of dressing like his partners, and I have to say he's never looked better. Alberto is a yes man; he says yes to everything, and it's impossible to embarrass him because he has no problem acting the fool. We could have told him that at French weddings it's really important for the groom to wear a red beret and can-can down the aisle, and he would have been like 'Sure.'. We really missed an opportunity there. Alberto is always willing to help us understand and tackle complicated Spanish bureaucracy issues like mortgages, laws, contracts, etc. When I rang him one day out of the blue to ask if he'd be my guarantor to rent my current flat, he didn't hesitate for a second. And Pauline is so warm, thoughtful, and fun, and only a little bit crazy. She makes it very easy to get to know her and to love her; she really cares for her loved ones and nourishes all her relationships, and we are so happy to now call her our friend. As a couple, they're very sociable and are great for getting everyone together. They've created a blended supergroup of friends, and just know that you created this monster; just because you're married now doesn't mean we're going to stop coming round, demanding snacks and drinks, and making trouble. They're also avid travelers and adventurers, and we know they're both very excited for the next adventure as a married couple, as we all are for them. We wish them all the best today and always.",

You've finally settled down here in this magnificent region where you've met this handsome ‘Andalou’, our 'Noisette'. He won your heart, and today we celebrate your union. Our family is growing again and becoming more cosmopolitan—French, Portuguese, and now Spanish. We even have a Belgian, so you can imagine. What could be more beautiful than love without borders? But what could be more important on this day than the love you embody? Poupette, we are so proud of you. Alberto, we entrust her to you—give her all the love and happiness she deserves, be happy. We love you all. Long live the bride and groom!",

    "text": "Hello to all my new friends from France, my name is Fran. And my name is Fran. We've already exhausted all the French we learned in high school. [Fran] For me, you have always been a source of inspiration, my guide in the midst of the most complicated journey. And thanks to this, you have been the reason I've unlocked important achievements in my life and leveled up in who I am, how I am, and where I am. So I wanted to take this moment to thank you:  Thank you for always being there when needed, like a good teammate in cooperative mode in Counter.  Thank you for giving me a beer whenever I was thirsty, like Moe in The Simpsons.  Thank you for the laughs shared from our first festivals until now, like Chewbacca and Han Solo in the Star Wars cantina.  Thank you for listening to me and giving me good advice when I needed it, like Barney Stinson to Ted Mosby.  Thank you for always being close, even when each of us is having our own adventures in different games.  Thank you for continuing to be part of my family, like Vito Corleone in The Godfather. And Pauline, there is no one in the world more incredible than you, with a more powerful mischievous laugh and a bigger heart. Thank you for coming into our lives and taking our fairy tale princess. Today is an amazing day; seeing you together is like watching the perfect team in action. We know there will be side quests, complicated dungeons, and final bosses along the way, but together you are an unstoppable team. And today marks the beginning of the most important game of all, so… let's keep playing and leveling up! [Parri] It seems like just a few weeks ago when you gave us all the wonderful news that you were getting married. What a great joy! For me, it was undoubtedly a tremendous joy to witness the radiant happiness you both had when telling “the teacher” and me at that moment, “THE FIRST ONES TO KNOW.” The same happy faces I see now at this awaited moment and the same joy you have maintained every day that has brought you to this place and this moment. I felt very fortunate to experience that news, I feel very fortunate to be part of this moment, I feel very fortunate that you are in my life. You are a mirror in which we all want to look. Long live the bride and groom!!",
